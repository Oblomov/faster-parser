Faster parsers
==============

Motivation
==========

When dealing with text-based file formats, one of the first discoveries
of many developers is that loading (deserializing) the data is often not
an I/O bound task. For many file formats [#ff]_, the bottleneck is rather in
*parsing* the data itself. Even (or maybe *especially*) when the data is
little more than a collection of integers or floating-point values,
developers quickly realize that most of the time is spent in standard
library functions such as `strtof` or `strtol`.

.. [#ff] examples include formats such as
   `Wavefront .obj <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file>`_,
   `Arc/INFO ASCII GRID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid>`_,
   `GRASS ASCII raster <https://grass.osgeo.org/grass75/manuals/r.in.ascii.html>`_.

What is this
============

A collection of routines to parse integers and floating-point data which
are considerably (in the whereabouts of 2Ã—) faster than the standard
library functions. The speed obviously comes at a price, as my routines
are less robust and less featureful than the standard library ones: they
are not be intended as *general purpose* replacements for the standard
library ones, but rather as faster alternatives in contexts where the
flexibility and robustness of the standard library ones can be forgone
(e.g. for known-good data).

``fast_parse_{u,}int{32,64}``
-----------------------------

Defined in ``parse-int.h``,
these are functions that are used to parse a 32- or 64-bit signed or
unsigned integer from its base-10 ASCII representation. No attempt
is made at skipping leading whitespace, to allow faster parsing in case
other symbols are used as separators. There is also no overflow check
and no check for actual digits.

While they are presented here in function form, in my experience it is
possible to achieve measurably faster performance by manually inlining
the code in the hot path. This is made easier by the provided
``CHECK_SIGN`` and ``FAST_DIGIT_LOOP`` macros.

``fast_parse_float32``
----------------------

Defined in ``parse-float.h``,
this function mimics the behavior of the standard ``strtof``, under the
additional assumptions that:

* the source is a base-10 ASCII representation, without thousands
  separator and with the dot ``.`` (ASCII 46) as decimal separator;
* the result is expected to be a 32-bit (single precision) IEEE-754
  binary floating-point number.

Some of the speed gain is achieved by only actually parsing at most 9
significant digits of the mantissa into an unsigned 64-bit integer
(using a couple of slightly modified versions of the ``fast_parse_uint64``
function above).

Note that while there is no risk of overflow for the mantissa (due to
the cap to 9 decimal digits, which are guaranteed to fit in a 64-bit
number), no overflow check is done for the exponent. This shouldn't be
an issue in practice (since a decimal exponent higher than 38 in
absolute value would result in floating-point overflow, i.e. infinity),
but may lead to misparsing of invalid values.

Currently the only observed discrepancies from the standard library are
in the parsing of some denormals when represented with a very low number
of digits.

``base10_to_base2_float``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This function converts a combination of unsigned 64-bit integer mantissa
``M`` and signed 32-bit integer base-10 exponent ``e10`` into the closest
32-bit (single precision) IEEE-754 binary floating-point approximation
to ``M*pow(10,e10)``. It is used to produce the final output by
``fast_parse_float32``.

SIMD parsers
============

An experimental parser that leverages AVX2 intrinsics is available
in the ``simd-int.h`` header. This is exposed via
``simd_parse_{u,}int{32,64}`` functions that mirror the
``fast_parse_{u,}int{32,64}`` set.

Performance is presently somewhat lackluster: they are still faster
than the standard library, but not as fast as the ``fast`` variant.
